# CS162 Pre-Class Work
This is your personal repository for you to upload your pre-class work submissions. Please note that a folder has been created for each session. Once you have cloned your repository onto your computer, you will need to ensure that you [add](https://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/commands/git-add/) and [commit](https://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/commands/git-commit/) your work to the correct folder, and [push](https://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/commands/git-push/) back to your online repository prior to each class. Here are some tips to make the process easier:

1. Feel free to make multiple commits as you keep working on your pre-class work. Git is a powerful tool for version control used widely in industry, and this practice will serve you well later on. Regular commits make it possible to revert to earlier versions of your code if you accidentally break something by making a change.
2. Please use Python virtual environments but don't commit them into the repository, since these will often be quite large. They can be found in a folder (usually `.venv` or `venv`). You can ensure that they are not committed by adding them to a [.gitignore](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore) file. You can also add other files and folders here that you wish to keep untracked.
3. [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) provides a GUI to add, commit and push submissions, for those who prefer using a graphical interface to using terminal directly. (If you are aiming to become a professional software engineer, I would encourage you to get comfortable with the command line; there are many situations where it will be all you can use, eg working on a remote server!)
4. For some of the sessions the TA will fetch your repo, and checkout the master branch as it existed at the exact start time of class. Please make sure that you have merged your changes to master before then. In your group projects you will need to work on your own personal branch and perform a code review before merging to master. Here in your PCW repo, you can work in master and push to master directly. Know that it is bad practice though, and generally discouraged in most circumstances!
5. Session 3 will focus on using git effectively in a team setting (ie. for your final project). This will also help you significantly in using your PCW repo, and it is expected that you are using it for session 4.
